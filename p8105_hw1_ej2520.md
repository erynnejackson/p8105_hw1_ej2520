# HW1 Problem 1

Here, we are loading the penguins dataset:

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
numb_rows = nrow(penguins)
numb_cols = ncol(penguins)
mean(penguins$flipper_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)
```

    ## [1] 200.9152

There are 344 rows in the penguins dataset and 8 columns, including
species, island, bill length (mm), flipper length (mm), body mass (g),
sex, and year. The mean flipper length is 200.91 mm.

Next, we are creating a scatterplot by flipper_length_mm and
bill_length_mm:

``` r
ggplot(penguins, aes(x=bill_length_mm, y=flipper_length_mm, color = species)) + geom_point()
```

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range
    ## (`geom_point()`).

# Problem 2

We are creating a data frame comprised of: a random sample of size 10
from a standard Normal distribution, a logical vector indicating whether
elements of the sample are greater than 0, a character vector of length
10, and a factor variable of length 10 with 3 different levels.

``` r
library(tidyverse)

prob2_df = tibble(
norm_samp = rnorm(10),
norm_samp_pos= norm_samp > 0, 
vec_char = c("A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G", "H", "J", "I"),
vec_factor = factor(c("apple", "pear", "apple", "kiwi", "pear", "pear", "apple", "apple", "kiwi", "pear")),
numeric_char = as.numeric(vec_char),
numeric_factor = as.numeric(vec_factor),
)


mean_samp = mean(pull(prob2_df, norm_samp))

mean_pos = mean(pull(prob2_df, norm_samp_pos))

mean_char = mean(pull(prob2_df, vec_char))

mean_factor = mean(pull(prob2_df, vec_factor))

mean_num_char = mean(pull(prob2_df, numeric_char))

mean_num_factor = mean(pull(prob2_df, numeric_factor))
```

The mean of the random sample of size 10 is -0.3675. The mean of the
elements greater than 0 is 0.4. The mean of the character vector and the
factor vector is not available.

Since the character and factor vector are not numeric or logical, we
need to apply the as.numeric function. After applying the as.numeric
function, the character vector is still not available, but the mean of
the factor vector is 2. With the factor vector, the characters are
assigned a numeric value.
